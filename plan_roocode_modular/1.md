# Step 1: Overall Structure and Approach

## Objective

Create a modular system to enhance the RooCode CLI workflow with the following capabilities:
- Accept and save user questions to question.md
- Handle experiment folders (existing or new)
- Copy optional files to the experiment folder
- Handle optional prompts and save to outline.md
- Manage git operations
- Execute the workflow and report results

## System Architecture

We'll create a new script called `roocode-modular.sh` that will:

1. Accept input parameters:
   - User question text
   - Experiment folder name
   - Optional list of files to copy (source and destination)
   - Optional prompt text

2. Process these inputs to:
   - Create or verify the experiment folder
   - Save the user question to question.md
   - Copy any specified files
   - Save the prompt to outline.md if provided
   - Manage git operations
   - Execute the workflow
   - Report results

## Implementation Approach

We'll break down the implementation into the following modular components:

1. **Input Processing**: Parse and validate command-line arguments
2. **Experiment Folder Management**: Create or verify the experiment folder
3. **File Management**: Save question.md, outline.md, and copy specified files
4. **Git Operations**: Manage git repository operations
5. **Workflow Execution**: Run the RooCode CLI with the virtual display
6. **Result Reporting**: Capture and report test results and branch name

## Testing Strategy

For each component:
1. Implement the component
2. Create test cases to verify functionality
3. Test the component in isolation
4. Test the component integrated with previously implemented components

This approach ensures that each component works correctly before moving on to the next one, and that the entire system works correctly as a whole.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Step 1 (Current)**: Define overall structure and approach
2. **Step 2**: Implement input processing and experiment folder management
3. **Step 3**: Implement file management
4. **Step 4**: Implement git operations
5. **Step 5**: Implement workflow execution and result reporting
6. **Step 6**: Create comprehensive tests and documentation

## Next Steps

In the next step, we'll implement the input processing and experiment folder management components. This will include:
- Parsing command-line arguments
- Validating inputs
- Creating or verifying the experiment folder
- Basic error handling

We'll create a script that can be tested independently before integrating it with the rest of the system.
