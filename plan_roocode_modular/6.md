# Step 6: Comprehensive Testing and Documentation

## Objective

Create comprehensive tests and documentation for the RooCode modular system. This includes:
- End-to-end tests for the entire workflow
- Documentation for users and developers
- Examples of common use cases
- Troubleshooting guide

## Testing Design

### End-to-End Tests

We'll create a comprehensive test suite that:
1. Tests the entire workflow with various inputs
2. Verifies that all components work correctly together
3. Tests error handling and edge cases
4. Provides clear feedback on test results

### Component Tests

We'll create individual test scripts for each component:
1. Input processing and validation
2. Experiment folder management
3. File management
4. Git operations
5. Workflow execution
6. Result reporting

### Test Automation

We'll create a script to run all tests automatically and report results.

## Documentation Design

### User Documentation

We'll create user documentation that:
1. Explains the purpose and capabilities of the system
2. Provides clear instructions for using the system
3. Includes examples of common use cases
4. Includes a troubleshooting guide

### Developer Documentation

We'll create developer documentation that:
1. Explains the architecture and design of the system
2. Provides details on each component
3. Includes information on how to extend or modify the system
4. Includes a guide for contributing to the project

## Implementation

### Test Scripts

We'll create the following test scripts:

1. `test-all.sh`: Runs all tests and reports results
2. `test-input-processing.sh`: Tests input processing and validation
3. `test-experiment-folder.sh`: Tests experiment folder management
4. `test-file-management.sh`: Tests file management
5. `test-git-operations.sh`: Tests git operations
6. `test-workflow-execution.sh`: Tests workflow execution
7. `test-end-to-end.sh`: Tests the entire workflow

Example of `test-all.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-all.sh - Run all tests for the RooCode modular system

# Function to run a test script and report results
function run_test {
  local script="$1"
  local name="$2"
  
  echo "Running ${name} tests..."
  
  # Run the test script
  ./${script}
  
  # Check the exit code
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "${name} tests: PASSED"
    return 0
  else
    echo "${name} tests: FAILED"
    return 1
  fi
}

# Main function
function main {
  echo "Running all tests for the RooCode modular system..."
  echo ""
  
  local failed=0
  
  # Run each test script
  run_test "test-input-processing.sh" "Input Processing" || ((failed++))
  run_test "test-experiment-folder.sh" "Experiment Folder Management" || ((failed++))
  run_test "test-file-management.sh" "File Management" || ((failed++))
  run_test "test-git-operations.sh" "Git Operations" || ((failed++))
  run_test "test-workflow-execution.sh" "Workflow Execution" || ((failed++))
  run_test "test-end-to-end.sh" "End-to-End" || ((failed++))
  
  echo ""
  if [ ${failed} -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "All tests passed!"
    exit 0
  else
    echo "${failed} test(s) failed."
    exit 1
  fi
}

# Execute main function
main
```

### Documentation Files

We'll create the following documentation files:

1. `README.md`: Overview and quick start guide
2. `USER_GUIDE.md`: Detailed user documentation
3. `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`: Detailed developer documentation
4. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: Troubleshooting guide
5. `EXAMPLES.md`: Examples of common use cases

Example of `README.md`:

```markdown
# RooCode Modular System

A modular system for enhancing the RooCode CLI workflow with additional capabilities.

## Features

- Accept and save user questions to question.md
- Handle experiment folders (existing or new)
- Copy optional files to the experiment folder
- Handle optional prompts and save to outline.md
- Manage git operations
- Execute the workflow and report results

## Quick Start

```bash
./roocode-modular.sh \
  --question "Your question here" \
  --expt "experiment_folder" \
  --files "source1:dest1,source2:dest2" \
  --prompt "Optional prompt text"
```

## Documentation

- [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md): Detailed user documentation
- [Developer Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md): Detailed developer documentation
- [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md): Troubleshooting guide
- [Examples](EXAMPLES.md): Examples of common use cases

## Docker Considerations

In preparation for the Docker implementation plan, we'll document the following considerations:

1. **Environment Variables**: Identify environment variables that need to be passed to the Docker container
2. **Volume Mounting**: Identify directories that need to be mounted as volumes
3. **Network Configuration**: Identify network requirements for the Docker container
4. **Resource Requirements**: Identify CPU, memory, and disk space requirements
5. **Security Considerations**: Identify security requirements and best practices

## Next Steps

With the completion of this step, we'll have a fully tested and documented RooCode modular system. The next phase will be to create a Docker implementation plan based on the considerations documented in this step.
