# Roo Code CLI with Virtual Display: Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a concise summary of the implementation for running the Roo Code CLI with a virtual display in headless environments. It covers the key components, approaches, and solutions to common issues.

## Key Components

1. **Virtual Display**: Using Xvfb to create a virtual X server for VS Code to render on.
2. **Environment Variables**: Configuring environment variables to optimize VS Code behavior.
3. **VS Code Flags**: Adding command-line flags to disable problematic features.
4. **Wrapper Scripts**: Creating scripts to automate the setup and execution process.

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Wrapper Script Approach

The simplest approach using a wrapper script (`run-cli-with-xvfb.sh`) that:
- Sets up Xvfb with optimal settings
- Configures environment variables
- Runs the CLI command
- Cleans up Xvfb

### 2. CLI Code Modification Approach

A more integrated approach that modifies the CLI code to:
- Check if running in a headless environment
- Set up Xvfb if needed
- Configure environment variables
- Run the CLI command
- Clean up Xvfb

### 3. Systemd Service Approach

A system-wide approach that sets up Xvfb as a systemd service:
- Creates a systemd service file for Xvfb
- Starts the service
- Configures environment variables
- Runs the CLI command

## Solutions to Common Issues

### OS Keyring Issues

**Problem**: VS Code attempts to use the OS keyring to store encryption-related data, which is not available in headless environments.

**Solution**: 
```typescript
ELECTRON_ENABLE_SECURITY_WARNINGS: "false"
```

### Workspace Trust Popup

**Problem**: VS Code shows a workspace trust popup when opening a workspace for the first time.

**Solution**:
```bash
code --disable-workspace-trust --disable-keytar -n ${workspacePath}
```

### ServiceWorker Registration Errors

**Problem**: ServiceWorker registration can fail in headless environments.

**Solution**:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/Code/Cache/*
rm -rf ~/.config/Code/CachedData/*
```

### VS Code Terminal Integration Warning

**Problem**: The Roo Code extension shows a warning when commands are executed without VS Code terminal shell integration.

**Solution**: This warning is informational and doesn't affect functionality. It can be disabled in the Roo Code extension settings.

## Package Compatibility

Some packages required for optimal VS Code rendering might not be available in all Ubuntu versions:
- `libgl1-mesa-glx`
- `libegl1-mesa`
- `libasound2`

The implementation handles this by attempting to install packages one by one and continuing even if some are not available.

## Recommended Approach

The recommended approach is to use the wrapper script (`run-cli-with-xvfb.sh`) for most cases, as it:
- Requires no code changes
- Is simple to implement
- Can be used with any version of the CLI
- Handles package compatibility issues

For more permanent solutions, the systemd service approach can be used.

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust solution for running the Roo Code CLI in headless environments, addressing common issues such as OS keyring prompts, workspace trust popups, and ServiceWorker registration errors.
