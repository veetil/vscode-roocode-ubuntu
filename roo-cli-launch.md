# Roo Code CLI with Virtual Display Implementation

I've completed a comprehensive solution for running the Roo Code CLI with a virtual display in headless environments. This implementation addresses the issues you mentioned, including OS keyring prompts, workspace trust popups, ServiceWorker registration errors, and VS Code terminal integration issues.

## Key Components Created

1. **Scripts**:
   - `run-cli-with-xvfb.sh` - Wrapper script to run the CLI with a virtual display
   - `setup-xvfb-service.sh` - Script to set up Xvfb as a systemd service
   - `test-cli-with-xvfb.sh` - Script to test the CLI with a virtual display
   - `apply-cli-patch.sh` - Script to apply the CLI patch
   - `list-files.sh` - Script to verify all files are present

2. **Documentation**:
   - `README.md` - Main README file with overview and usage instructions
   - `README-cli-with-xvfb.md` - Detailed README for the wrapper script
   - `vscode-virtual-display-research.md` - Comprehensive research document
   - `roocode-cli-virtual-display-summary.md` - Summary of the implementation

3. **Patch Files**:
   - `cli-virtual-display.patch` - Patch for the CLI code to incorporate virtual display improvements

## Implementation Approaches

The solution provides three different approaches:

1. **Wrapper Script** - The simplest approach, requiring no code changes
2. **CLI Code Modification** - An integrated approach that modifies the CLI code
3. **Systemd Service** - A system-wide approach for persistent virtual display

## Package Compatibility Improvements

I've updated the scripts to handle package compatibility issues across different Ubuntu versions:

- Scripts now attempt to install packages one by one
- Scripts continue even if some packages are not available
- Documentation notes which packages might not be available in all Ubuntu versions

## Usage

To run the Roo Code CLI with a virtual display:

```bash
./run-cli-with-xvfb.sh python grep
```

The script can be run from any directory. It will automatically change to the correct directory (`~/LaunchRoo/Roo-Code/evals`) to run the CLI command.

## Research and Documentation

I've created comprehensive documentation that:

1. Explores what's happening inside the Roo-Code folder
2. Documents the changes that have been made
3. Explains how VS Code is managed with a virtual GUI
4. Compares the mechanisms for opening VS Code in different scenarios
5. Provides solutions to common issues

This implementation should provide a robust solution for running the Roo Code CLI in headless environments, addressing all the issues you mentioned.
