# Mac-Specific Components in Roo-Code Autostart

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I've identified the following Mac-specific components that need to be addressed when porting to Ubuntu on AWS:

## 1. Shell Commands

In `Roo-Code/evals/apps/cli/src/index.ts`, the CLI uses `/bin/bash` explicitly for launching VS Code:

```javascript
await execa({
  env: {
    ROO_CODE_IPC_SOCKET_PATH: taskSocketPath,
  },
  shell: "/bin/bash",
})`code --disable-workspace-trust -n ${workspacePath}`
```

While `/bin/bash` is also available on Ubuntu, the command execution pattern might behave differently.

## 2. VS Code Launch Command

The command to launch VS Code (`code --disable-workspace-trust -n ${workspacePath}`) may have Mac-specific behavior, particularly in how it handles window management and workspace paths.

## 3. GUI Requirements

The most significant challenge is that Roo Code requires a graphical interface since it launches VS Code with a GUI. On a headless AWS Ubuntu instance, this will require setting up a virtual display environment.

## 4. IPC Communication

The system uses Unix domain sockets for IPC communication between the CLI and VS Code extension:

```javascript
const socketPath = path.resolve(os.tmpdir(), `roo-code-evals-${crypto.randomUUID().slice(0, 8)}.sock`);
```

While Unix sockets work on both macOS and Ubuntu, the path handling and permissions might differ.

## 5. Process Management

The system uses `ps-tree` for process management, which might behave differently on Ubuntu:

```javascript
const descendants = await new Promise<number[]>((resolve, reject) => {
  psTree(subprocess.pid!, (err, children) => {
    if (err) {
      reject(err)
    }
    resolve(children.map((p) => parseInt(p.PID)))
  })
})
```

## 6. File Path Handling

Some file path handling might be Mac-specific, particularly when resolving workspace paths and temporary directories.

## 7. Environment Variables

The system relies on environment variables for configuration, which need to be properly set up in the Ubuntu environment.
