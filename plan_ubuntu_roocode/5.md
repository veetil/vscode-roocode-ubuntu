# Setting Up Remote Access to VS Code on AWS

While Roo Code can run with a virtual display on a headless Ubuntu AWS instance, there might be cases where you need to access the VS Code UI for debugging or monitoring. This document outlines several approaches for remote access.

## 1. SSH Tunneling with X11 Forwarding

This approach allows you to forward the X11 display from the AWS instance to your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- X11 server installed on your local machine (XQuartz for macOS, built-in for Linux, VcXsrv or Xming for Windows)
- SSH access to the AWS instance

### Setup Steps

#### 1.1. Install X11 Packages on AWS

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y x11-apps
```

#### 1.2. Configure SSH Server for X11 Forwarding

Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on the AWS instance:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Ensure these lines are uncommented and set to yes:

```
X11Forwarding yes
X11DisplayOffset 10
```

Restart SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

#### 1.3. Connect with X11 Forwarding

From your local machine:

```bash
ssh -X -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-aws-instance
```

For better performance, use the `-Y` flag (trusted X11 forwarding):

```bash
ssh -Y -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-aws-instance
```

#### 1.4. Test X11 Forwarding

On the AWS instance:

```bash
xeyes
```

You should see the xeyes application appear on your local display.

#### 1.5. Launch VS Code

```bash
code --disable-workspace-trust -n /path/to/workspace
```

## 2. VNC Server

VNC provides a full desktop environment that you can access remotely.

### Setup Steps

#### 2.1. Install VNC Server and Desktop Environment

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y tightvncserver xfce4 xfce4-goodies
```

#### 2.2. Configure VNC Server

Set up a password for VNC:

```bash
vncpasswd
```

Create a VNC startup script:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vnc
cat > ~/.vnc/xstartup << 'EOL'
#!/bin/bash
xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
startxfce4 &
EOL
chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup
```

#### 2.3. Start VNC Server

```bash
vncserver :1 -geometry 1280x800 -depth 24
```

#### 2.4. Set Up SSH Tunnel for VNC

From your local machine:

```bash
ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-aws-instance
```

#### 2.5. Connect with VNC Client

Use a VNC client (like VNC Viewer, RealVNC, or TigerVNC) to connect to:

```
localhost:5901
```

Enter the password you set earlier.

#### 2.6. Launch VS Code in the VNC Session

In the VNC session, open a terminal and run:

```bash
code --disable-workspace-trust -n /path/to/workspace
```

## 3. VS Code Remote SSH Extension

This approach uses VS Code's built-in Remote SSH extension to connect to the AWS instance.

### Setup Steps

#### 3.1. Install VS Code Remote SSH Extension

In VS Code on your local machine, install the "Remote - SSH" extension.

#### 3.2. Configure SSH Connection

Add your AWS instance to VS Code's SSH configuration:

1. Press `F1` and select "Remote-SSH: Open Configuration File..."
2. Add your AWS instance:

```
Host aws-roocode
    HostName your-aws-instance-ip
    User ubuntu
    IdentityFile /path/to/your-key.pem
```

#### 3.3. Connect to AWS Instance

1. Press `F1` and select "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host..."
2. Select your AWS instance from the list
3. VS Code will connect to the AWS instance and set up a remote development environment

#### 3.4. Open Roo Code Workspace

Once connected, open the Roo Code workspace on the AWS instance:

1. Click "File > Open Folder..."
2. Navigate to the Roo Code directory
3. Click "OK"

## 4. Code Server (VS Code in Browser)

This approach runs VS Code in a browser using code-server.

### Setup Steps

#### 4.1. Install code-server

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh
```

#### 4.2. Configure code-server

Create a configuration file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/code-server
cat > ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml << 'EOL'
bind-addr: 127.0.0.1:8080
auth: password
password: your-secure-password
cert: false
EOL
```

#### 4.3. Start code-server

```bash
code-server --disable-telemetry
```

#### 4.4. Set Up SSH Tunnel for code-server

From your local machine:

```bash
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-aws-instance
```

#### 4.5. Access code-server

Open a browser on your local machine and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Enter the password you set in the configuration file.

#### 4.6. Install Roo Code Extension

In code-server:

1. Click the Extensions icon
2. Search for "Roo Code"
3. Install the extension

## 5. AWS EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint

For AWS EC2 instances, you can use EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint for secure browser-based SSH access without requiring a public IP address.

### Setup Steps

#### 5.1. Create EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint

In the AWS Console:

1. Navigate to VPC > Endpoints
2. Create a new endpoint
3. Select "EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint" as the service
4. Select your VPC and subnet
5. Configure security groups

#### 5.2. Connect via Browser

1. In the EC2 Console, select your instance
2. Click "Connect"
3. Select "EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint"
4. Click "Connect"

This opens a browser-based terminal. From there, you can use X11 forwarding or VNC as described above.

## Security Considerations

1. **Firewall Rules**: Ensure your security groups and firewall rules only allow connections from trusted IP addresses.

2. **SSH Keys**: Use SSH keys instead of passwords for authentication.

3. **VNC Passwords**: Use strong passwords for VNC access.

4. **SSH Tunneling**: Always use SSH tunneling to secure VNC and code-server connections.

5. **HTTPS**: Consider setting up HTTPS for code-server if exposing it directly.

## Troubleshooting

1. **X11 Forwarding Issues**:
   ```bash
   echo $DISPLAY  # Should not be empty
   xhost +        # Run on local machine to allow connections
   ```

2. **VNC Connection Issues**:
   ```bash
   vncserver -kill :1  # Kill existing VNC server
   vncserver :1        # Start a new VNC server
   ```

3. **SSH Tunnel Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Use verbose mode to diagnose
   ssh -v -L 5901:localhost:5901 -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-aws-instance
   ```

4. **code-server Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Check logs
   cat ~/.local/share/code-server/logs/code-server.log
