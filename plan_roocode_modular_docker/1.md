# Step 1: Docker Implementation - Overall Structure and Approach

## Objective

Create a Docker implementation of the RooCode modular system that can:
- Run in a containerized environment
- Accept inputs as described in the modular implementation
- Execute the RooCode workflow within the container
- Report results back to the host system

## Docker Architecture

We'll create a Docker implementation with the following components:

1. **Base Image**: Ubuntu-based image with all necessary dependencies
2. **RooCode Installation**: Scripts to install and configure RooCode within the container
3. **Modular System**: The RooCode modular system implemented in the previous plan
4. **Input Handling**: Mechanisms to pass inputs to the container
5. **Output Handling**: Mechanisms to report results back to the host system

## Implementation Approach

We'll break down the implementation into the following modular components:

1. **Dockerfile**: Define the container image with all necessary dependencies
2. **Entrypoint Script**: Handle container initialization and input processing
3. **Volume Mounting**: Define volumes for sharing data between host and container
4. **Environment Variables**: Define environment variables for configuration
5. **Result Reporting**: Mechanisms for reporting results back to the host

## Docker Container Design

### Base Image Selection

We'll use Ubuntu as the base image, as it's compatible with the RooCode system and has good support for the required dependencies.

### Container Structure

The container will have the following structure:

```
/app/                      # Application directory
  roocode-modular.sh       # Main script from the modular implementation
  run-cli-with-xvfb.sh     # Script to run RooCode CLI with virtual display
  entrypoint.sh            # Container entrypoint script
  tests/                   # Test scripts
  docs/                    # Documentation
/data/                     # Data directory (mounted as a volume)
  input/                   # Input files
  output/                  # Output files
/home/ubuntu/LaunchRoo/    # RooCode installation directory
```

### Input Handling

The container will accept inputs through:
1. **Environment Variables**: For simple inputs like the question and experiment folder
2. **Volume Mounting**: For file inputs and outputs
3. **Command-Line Arguments**: For additional configuration

### Output Handling

The container will report results through:
1. **Exit Code**: To indicate success or failure
2. **Output Files**: Written to a mounted volume
3. **Standard Output**: For logging and progress information

## Docker Workflow

1. **Build the Container**: Build the Docker image with all dependencies
2. **Prepare Inputs**: Create input files and set environment variables
3. **Run the Container**: Execute the container with the prepared inputs
4. **Process Outputs**: Retrieve and process the container outputs

## Implementation Plan

1. **Step 1 (Current)**: Define overall structure and approach
2. **Step 2**: Create Dockerfile and base container setup
3. **Step 3**: Implement entrypoint script and input handling
4. **Step 4**: Implement RooCode installation and configuration
5. **Step 5**: Implement the modular system within the container
6. **Step 6**: Implement output handling and result reporting
7. **Step 7**: Create comprehensive tests and documentation

## Next Steps

In the next step, we'll create the Dockerfile and base container setup. This will include:
- Selecting the appropriate base image
- Installing necessary dependencies
- Setting up the container structure
- Creating a basic entrypoint script

We'll create a Dockerfile that can be built and tested independently before adding the RooCode-specific components.
